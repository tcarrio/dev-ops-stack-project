### Mattermost Configuration

The `config.json` file is used for the initial settings of Mattermost. Further configurations can be made within the admin panel for user-friendly access, but all changes are saved to the database or `config.json` file. 

This configuration file can be used with a bare install of Mattermost. Ours has been specifically modified to allow for Single Sign-On access from GitLab. Set the FQDN's accordingly for each service if setting up for yourself.
